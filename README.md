# 🏡 Airbnb Listings 2016 Dashboard — Tableau Project

This project is a Tableau dashboard built using the [Airbnb Listings 2016 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset/data) available on Kaggle. I created this while learning Tableau to explore how to turn raw Airbnb data into meaningful insights through data visualization.
